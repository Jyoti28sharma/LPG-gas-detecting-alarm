I have made a LPG gas detecting alarm system.
IT is cost effective product.
When I search for the product online it costs Rs.1500,but I made it in RS.1100 though I purchased individuals component which shows thatwe can reduce more cost from it.
I used MQ-5 gas sensor to detect LPG gas in air.
I set a threshold value of 1000 ppm concentration of LPG in air.
If concentration of the LPG exceeds the 1000ppm then RED led blinks,buzzer makes sound, and 'GAS DETECTED' displayed in LCD.
If concentration of LPG is less than 1000 ppm then GREEN led blinks,NO buzzer sound and 'SAFE AIR' displayed in LCD.
